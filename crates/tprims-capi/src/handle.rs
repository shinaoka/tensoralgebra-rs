// is merely absent turns a C program that includes `<tapp.h>` and calls one into
// a **link** failure — the least diagnosable kind — whereas a refusal is a value
// the caller can check and explain. Found by the conformance suite, which
// re-declares the whole header and so notices what is missing from it.

// api/include/tapp/attributes.h), not reconstructed.
