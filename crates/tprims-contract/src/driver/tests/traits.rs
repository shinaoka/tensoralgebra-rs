//! The `Send`/`Sync` guarantees the threaded driver is built on.
//!
//! All of these hold by auto-derivation today, and that is the reason to pin
//! them: nothing in the crate *states* them, so one `Rc`, `Cell` or raw pointer
//! added to a private field of `Plan` would withdraw one silently. The
//! breakage would then surface as the executor refusing the closure in
//! `driver` or `batch` -- or, for `Error`, at a downstream caller whose
//! `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>` stops accepting it, which is not this crate's
//! test suite at all.
//!
//! Nothing here runs: the assertions are discharged by type checking, and the
//! `#[test]` exists only to give them a call site.
