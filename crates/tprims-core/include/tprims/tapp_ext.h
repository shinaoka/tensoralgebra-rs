/* tprims extensions to the TAPP C API (not part of standard TAPP). Include
   <tapp.h> alone for serial contraction; this header adds the Rayon executor.

   The names are tprims-specific. A TAPP_executor is an intptr_t owned by the
   caller: it is created here (or by TAPP_create_executor), shared by any
   number of plans and BLAS calls of this library, and destroyed by the
   standard TAPP_destroy_executor, which stops and joins an owned pool. Handles
   of another TAPP provider cannot be mixed in. */
