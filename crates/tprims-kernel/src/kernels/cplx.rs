//! Native interleaved complex microkernel families for the packed driver
//! (issue #30). Opt-in only: no family here is `allow_auto`, so the default
//! selection is unchanged; select one by id (`avx2.c64.native.4x4`,
//! `avx2.c32.native.8x4`) through `KernelChoice::Id`.
//!
//! Project-owned code, MIT OR Apache-2.0, written from the arithmetic
//! `Cr += Ar*Br - Ai*Bi; Ci += Ai*Br + Ar*Bi` with FMA (the interleaved
//! "swap and sign once per A vector" form discussed in issue #30). It is not a
//! port of `gemm-c64`/`gemm-c32` (their `microkernel` module is private) nor
//! of `private-gemm-x86` (its low-level entry points have a custom register
//! ABI); see `docs/provenance.md`. Packing, scatter, write-back, blocking and
//! scheduling are the existing driver's (Lukas Devos's tensorcontract driver
//! and the project's `tprims-kernel`); this crate only supplies tile
//! kernels and their descriptors.
//!
//! # Tile contract
//!
//! `A` per k step: `[ar0, ai0, ar1, ai1, ...]` (`2*MR` reals), `B` per k step
//! `[br0, bi0, ...]` (`2*NR` reals), `kc` is the logical complex depth. The
//! kernel **overwrites the whole** `2*MR*NR`-real column-major interleaved
//! tile (also for `kc == 0`), never reads it, and reads exactly
//! `2*MR*kc`/`2*NR*kc` reals of the panels. All loads and stores are
//! unaligned.
