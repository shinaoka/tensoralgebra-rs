//! Complex arithmetic induced from a real micro-kernel.
//!
//! BLIS's 1m and 4m methods compute a complex product with real kernels only.
//! Here they are generated from any registered real family, so a complex
//! contraction can be switched onto a real kernel's arithmetic — for reference
//! results, for a machine whose complex kernel is suspect, and for comparing
//! the three methods against each other on one panel layout.
//!
//! * **1m** packs A with [`PackFormat::OneE`] and B with `OneR` (the planar
//!   format),
//!   and calls the real kernel with *twice* the logical k, because one complex
//!   k-step is two real k-steps of the 2x2 real block
//!   `[[re, -im], [im, re]]`. The resulting `2*mr' x nr` real tile is exactly
//!   [`TileFormat::OneM`], so no recombination beyond the existing write-back is
//!   needed.
//! * **4m** packs both operands planar and makes four overwrite calls into the
//!   four planes of a [`TileFormat::FourM`] tile. The four panels are copied
//!   into contiguous real panels first, because the real kernel reads one
//!   panel per k-step while planar packing interleaves the planes; the copy is
//!   the price of reusing an unmodified real kernel and is not optimised here.
//!
//! Both take `allow_auto: false`: the compiled menus already offer their own
//! native 1m, and induced families exist to be *chosen*, not to compete with it.
