//! AArch64 NEON vectorised micro-kernels.
//!
//! **Not part of the public API.** `#[doc(hidden)]` and outside the semver
//! guarantee, on the same terms as `kernel::x86`: public only so that
//! `examples/kernel_shapes` can measure one kernel family at a time, and the
//! register-block menus are re-measured whenever the machine changes. Reach the
//! kernels through [`super::KernelSet`].
//!
//! The bodies are not written here. They come from `simd_kernels!` in
//! `kernel::simd`, the same macro that generates the AVX-512 and AVX2 kernels,
//! so a NEON-vs-AVX comparison is not also a comparison between two people's
//! hand-written kernels (D17).
//!
//! # Why this exists, and what it is worth
//!
//! Not because the portable path was unvectorised — **it was already
//! vectorised.** LLVM compiles `scalar::real_ukr`'s 4x4 tile into eight
//! `float64x2_t` accumulators with `ld1r.2d` broadcasts and lane-indexed
//! `fmul.2d`, unasked. What it will not emit is `fmla`, because `acc += a * b`
//! is two roundings and IEEE forbids contracting them. So the portable path
//! spends **two instructions per multiply-accumulate where the machine offers
//! one**, which halves the ceiling available to it, and that single instruction
//! form is most of the gap to a tuned baseline (A58).
//!
//! The consequence for this module: its headline win is **FMA contraction, worth
//! about 2x, not 10x**, plus whatever better register blocking buys — the scalar
//! tile uses 8 of 32 vector registers. Do not expect more, and do not justify
//! work here with the older "no vectorised kernel off x86" claim, which was true
//! of the source and false of the binary.
//!
//! # Register blocking
//!
//! NEON is **32 x 128-bit** registers: `L = 2` lanes for `f64`, `4` for `f32`.
//! Narrower than AVX2's 4 and AVX-512's 8, so **no shape transfers from either**
//! — the menus in `x86.rs` are not a starting point. The budget is the same
//! accounting `x86`'s module docs set out, `live = accumulators + A planes +
//! broadcasts <= 32`:
//!
//! | method | `live` | candidates (`MV x NR`) → logical `MR x NR`, `f64` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | real | `MV*NR + MV + 1` | `(3,8)` → `6x8`, `(4,6)` → `8x6`, `(2,10)` → `4x10` |
//! | planar | `2*MV*NR + 2*MV + 2` | `(2,6)` → `4x6`, `(3,4)` → `6x4`, `(1,12)` → `2x12` |
//! | 1m | `MV*NR + MV + 1` | `(3,8)` → `6x8` complex `3x8`… (real block, halved) |
//! | 3m | `3*MV*NR + MV + 1` | `(1,8)` → `2x8`, `(2,4)` → `4x4`, `(3,3)` → `6x3` |
//!
//! **The two leading `real` candidates are exactly the shapes BLIS's own AArch64
//! `dgemm` kernels use** — `bli_dgemm_armv8a_asm_6x8` and `8x6r` — and the `f32`
//! ones land on its `12x8r` and `8x12`. That is independent corroboration that
//! the budget arithmetic is right, from a library that measured it; it is *not* a
//! measurement of this engine's kernels.
//!
//! # The shipped shapes are MEASURED, and the budget did not pick them
//!
//! Three arms of `examples/kernel_shapes` on an M3 Max
//! (`bench-results/CKF6QCDVPD-m3max/kernel-shapes*.txt`, `docs/notebook/apple-silicon.md` part
//! 21). The menus in [`cfg_neon_f64`] / [`cfg_neon_f32`] are that measurement,
//! ordered by it, and each carries its own margin against the session floor.
//!
//! **The budget filtered half the columns well and chose badly in three**,
//! which is A34 restated rather than a new finding. The `!` over-budget flag is
//! a clean separator for `planar` and `3m` — its shapes are the bottom of those
//! columns in both dtypes — and unreliable for `real` and `1m`, where
//! over-budget shapes appear at the *top*. `f64` real is the sharp case: the
//! budget proposed `6x8`, BLIS's own shape, and the machine prefers `16x3` by
//! 4.9% — a shape the budget calls *over* its limit.
//!
//! Register blocks are per-microarchitecture, so this is an M3 Max result and
//! not a NEON one. Re-run the sweep on any other Apple part before quoting it.
