/// AVX2 shapes for `f64` / `c64` (`L = 4`). **Provisional and unmeasured** — see
/// the note below on which half of the choice is modelled.
///
/// 16 ymm instead of 32 zmm, and the same accumulator-plane counts, so the
/// register bound bites much harder than it does on AVX-512. With `live =
/// accumulators + one A plane + the live broadcasts`:
///
/// | kernel | `MV x NR` | `MR x NR` (logical) | acc | live | load | FMA | f/l | bytes/flop |
/// |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
/// | real | `2 x 6` | `8 x 6` | 12 | 15 | 8 | 12 | 1.50 | **1.17** |
/// | planar | `1 x 5` | `4 x 5` | 10 | 14 | 12 | 20 | 1.67 | **0.90** |
/// | 1m | `2 x 6` | `4 x 6` | 12 | 15 | 16 | 24 | 1.50 | 1.17 |
/// | 3m | `1 x 4` | `4 x 4` | 12 | 14 | 15 | 12 | 0.80 | 1.50 |
///
/// # What is modelled and what is guessed
///
/// **Modelled, and trustworthy** (D19: the uop model gets the *cliffs* right):
///
/// * `live <= 16` for every shape on every menu. That is the only hard
///   statement here, and it is the one that matters most, because a spill costs
///   30–50% — far more than any ranking error among shapes that fit. It was
///   **checked in the disassembly**, which needs no benchmark: every shipped
///   default in both precisions (six distinct kernels — 1m reuses `real`)
///   allocates 15–16 distinct ymm with *zero* stack traffic in the loop, while
///   `planar 1 x 6` (`live = 16`) spills one register and `planar 2 x 3`
///   (`live = 18`) spills seven. The model's cliff is where the model says.
/// * `acc >= 10`, i.e. enough independent accumulator chains to cover an FMA
///   latency of ~5 cycles against two FMA ports. Below that the kernel is
///   latency-bound however good its byte traffic is. Both survive only just:
///   planar's default has exactly 10 and 3m's exactly 12.
/// * Which shape has the lowest bytes-per-useful-flop within each method, which
///   is the quantity Phase 3 measured to be decisive at the operating `kc`.
///
/// **Guessed** (D19: the same model gets the *ranking* wrong):
///
/// * That the byte-traffic argument still picks the winner when the register
///   file is half as large. It may not: with `MR` down to 4 complex rows the A
///   sliver is small enough that it could stay L1-resident, which is precisely
///   the regime where Phase 3 measured 3m to be *fastest*. So the ranking
///   between the three complex methods is genuinely open on AVX2, more open
///   than it was on AVX-512.
/// * `NR` for planar — though less than it was. `1 x 6` reaches `live = 16`
///   exactly and would give 12 accumulators and 0.83 bytes/flop, strictly
///   better on both counts *if* it allocated cleanly; the disassembly says it
///   does not quite (one spill/reload pair per k-step, against `1 x 5`'s none),
///   which settles the choice without a measurement. What stays guessed is the
///   *price*: one spill of a broadcast is nothing like the 30–50% a spilled
///   accumulator costs, so `1 x 6` might still win. **It could now go on the menu
///   as an alternate** — that was impossible when this was written, because the
///   menu was keyed by `MR` and both shapes have `MR = 4`, but D43 re-keyed it by
///   *position* precisely so an `NR`-only alternate is expressible (that is what
///   made A35's `32x5` reachable in `f32` planar). Appending `(1, 6)` here would
///   make it an `idx=` arm; it has not been done because nothing has asked to
///   measure it and an unmeasured menu entry is a liability.
/// * 3m's default. `1 x 4` is load-port-bound (`f/l = 0.80`) and `2 x 2`
///   (`MR = 8`, on the menu) is exactly balanced at `f/l = 1.00` but moves 25%
///   more bytes per flop. `1 x 4` follows the AVX-512 precedent, where the
///   measured 3m winner `1 x 10` was *also* load-bound and *also* the lowest
///   bytes/flop of its candidates — but that is an analogy, not a measurement.
/// * That one shape per method can be right for all AVX2 hardware at all. The
///   AVX2 microarchitectures spread wider than the AVX-512 ones: FMA latency is
///   5 on Haswell/Broadwell and 4 on later Intel and Zen 3, which moves the
///   `acc >= 10` floor, and Zen 1 splits every 256-bit op into two 128-bit
///   halves, which moves everything. These shapes are a starting point on
///   whatever machine gets measured first, not a tuning.
///
/// Calibrate with `cargo run --release -p tensorcontract --example
/// kernel_shapes` **on an AVX2 machine** — the example sweeps the AVX2 grid too
/// and prints `acc`/`load`/`FMA`/`bytes-per-flop` next to measured GF/s, so the
/// menus below can be replaced from its output the way the AVX-512 ones were.
///
/// # The menus
///
/// | method | menu, `MR` (`NR`) | why the alternates exist |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | real | 8 (6), 12 (4), 4 (8) | `12 (4)` is `live = 16` with a better `f/l`; `4 (8)` is load-bound and only there for the row-block rule |
/// | planar | 4 (5), 8 (2) | `8 (2)` is the only other aspect ratio that fits at all |
/// | 1m | 4 (6), 6 (4), 2 (8) | as real, halved: 1m's complex tile is half its real row block |
/// | 3m | 4 (4), 8 (2) | the load-bound / balanced pair described above |
///
/// Note what the small blocks do to the write-back: **every** `MR` on every
/// menu here (2, 4, 6, 8, 12) divides 24, and the TCCG corpus rounds every
/// stride-1 extent up to a multiple of 24, so the gather-path problem that
/// motivated the row-block menu on AVX-512 does not arise at all in `f64` on
/// AVX2, which is one reason these menus can stay short.
///
/// `tcbench shapes` says so quantitatively, and it costs no CPU to re-check
/// (`TENSORCONTRACT_KERNEL=avx2 tcbench shapes`, which tcbench parses into a pinned-ISA tuning). Over the 392 corpus
/// case-dtype-methods, `Plan::row_block` would change shape on **26 under
/// AVX-512 and 12 under AVX2**, and the 12 are all `f32` — it is inert in `f64`
/// and in all three complex methods in both precisions. The sharper number is
/// the other one: **81** case-dtype-methods have no shape on their AVX-512 menu
/// that clears the gather path at all, and **0** on their AVX2 menu. Smaller
/// register blocks are worse for the kernel and better for the write-back, and
/// on AVX2 the write-back side of that trade is simply won.
