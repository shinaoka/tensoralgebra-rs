/// AVX-512 shapes for `f64` / `c64` (`L = 8`), measured at the `kc = 256` that
/// [`Blocking::derive`] picks for 8-byte reals.

/// |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
/// | real | `3 x 8` | `24 x 8` | 24 | 11 | 24 | 0.67 | 88.4 |

/// Note the shapes are *not* interchangeable between methods. Every candidate
/// needing more than 32 live vector registers — accumulators plus one A plane
/// plus the broadcasts — falls off a cliff of 30–50%, which is what rules out

/// bytes-per-useful-flop, not FMA count: see the module docs.
///
/// The alternates on each menu, and what they cost at the operating `kc`
/// (fraction of the default's throughput, from the Phase 4.1c re-run of
/// `examples/kernel_shapes`):
///
/// | method | menu, `MR` (`NR`) | cost of each alternate |
/// |---|---|---|

/// Those within a couple of percent of 1.00 are ties at the sweep's own
/// repeatability, not free lunches; the menu is ordered by the Phase 3 choice,
/// which is not re-litigated here.
