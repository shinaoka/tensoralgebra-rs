//! x86-64 vectorised micro-kernels.
//!
//! **Not part of the public API.** This module is `#[doc(hidden)]` and outside
//! the crate's semver guarantee; it is public only so that
//! `examples/kernel_shapes` can measure one kernel family at a time. The
//! register-block menus below are re-measured whenever the reference machine
//! changes, so nothing here is stable. Reach the kernels through
//! [`super::KernelSet`].
//!
//! These honour exactly the same [`PackFormat`](crate::PackFormat) / [`TileFormat`](crate::TileFormat) contract as
//! [`scalar`](super::reference::scalar), which is what keeps the three complex methods
//! interchangeable: the driver, the packing traversal and the write-back do not
//! know which kernel they are running.
//!
//! # Register blocking
//!
//! Write `MV` for the number of vector registers an `A` sliver occupies per
//! plane per k-step, `L` for the lane count (8 for AVX-512 `f64`, 16 for
//! AVX-512 `f32`; 4 and 8 for AVX2) and `NR` for the column block. Then per
//! logical k-step a kernel issues
//!
//! | | accumulator registers | load-port uops | FMA uops |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | real | `MV*NR` | `MV + NR` | `MV*NR` |
//! | planar | `2*MV*NR` | `2*MV + 2*NR` | `4*MV*NR` |
//! | 1m | `MV*NR` (real `2*MR x NR`) | `2*(MV + NR)` | `2*MV*NR` |
//! | 3m | `3*MV*NR` | `3*MV + 3*NR` | `3*MV*NR` |
//!
//! Skylake-SP retires two 512-bit FMAs and two loads per cycle, and LLVM emits
//! `vbroadcastsd` as its own uop rather than folding it into an FMA memory
//! operand (checked in the disassembly), so a kernel is issue-bound on FMAs
//! exactly when `FMA > loads`. Two things then decide the shape, and they pull
//! in opposite directions:
//!
//! 1. **The register file.** Accumulators plus one A plane plus the live
//!    broadcasts must fit in the architectural register file — 32 zmm under
//!    AVX-512, **16 ymm under AVX2**. Every candidate that does not spills and
//!    loses 30–50% — the sweep is full of these cliffs, and they are the reason
//!    3m cannot simply be given a big block.
//! 2. **Bytes per useful flop.** Once a shape is issue-bound the A sliver is a
//!    stream out of L2, not an L1 resident, and the packed footprint per flop
//!    becomes the binding constraint.
//!
//! The second point is the measured story, and it is not the one the flop
//! counts predict:
//!
//! * **planar** has the lowest bytes-per-flop of the three (two reals per
//!   complex element in *both* panels, and four FMAs from every (A-vector,
//!   B-scalar) pair with no in-register shuffling). It wins the corpus on both
//!   AVX-512 machines measured.
//! * **1m** issues the same FMAs but spread over two real k-steps and reads a
//!   packed `A` panel twice the size — 1.5x planar's bytes per flop.
//! * **3m** does 25% *fewer* FMAs and still loses, because it loads three
//!   planes of both operands to do it.
//!
//! The accounting above — bytes moved per useful flop, not flop count — is
//! arithmetic and holds everywhere. **Whether 3m's flop saving ever *pays* is a
//! per-microarchitecture question with no settled answer.** This module used to
//! claim that it pays with both panels L1-resident; that is a Cascade Lake
//! result and it does not transfer. At `kc = 16`, which is that regime, 3m leads
//! planar by 1.105 (`c64`) and 1.155 (`c32`) on Cascade Lake and trails at 0.567
//! and 0.662 on Ice Lake, where it wins at no depth, no shape and neither
//! precision while already running its own Ice Lake-optimal block. Ranking
//! anything below planar without naming the machine is a mistake this project
//! has made twice.
//!
//! The **AVX-512** shapes were chosen by measuring, not by the reasoning above:
//! `cargo run --release -p tensorcontract --example kernel_shapes`, raw output
//! in `bench-results/phase3-kernel-shapes.txt`.
//!
//! The **AVX2** shapes are *provisional and unmeasured* — see
//! [`cfg_avx2_f64`] — because the reference machine has no AVX2-only CPU to
//! measure them on and the same `examples/kernel_shapes` run is the calibration
//! path once one is available. Halving the register file is not a small change:
//! with 16 ymm, planar's two accumulator planes and 3m's three leave almost no
//! choice of aspect ratio, so AVX2 register blocks are 2–6x smaller than their
//! AVX-512 counterparts and are much closer to the register bound.
