//! Micro-kernels, complex methods, and cache blocking parameters.
//!
//! # The three complex methods
//!
//! Complex contraction can be induced from real arithmetic in several ways.
//! This crate implements three and lets the caller choose, because which one
//! wins depends on the shape, the element type and the machine — and because
//! the whole point of the project is to be able to measure them against each
//! other on equal footing. Select with [`ComplexMethod`], per plan via
//! `tensorcontract::Plan::with_complex_method` (`planar` | `1m` | `3m`); the
//! default is [`ComplexMethod::Planar`].
//!
//! All three share the *same* index analysis, scatter machinery, five-loop
//! driver and write-back path. They differ only in what packing emits, what
//! the micro-kernel computes, and how the accumulator tile is read back.
//!
//! ## Packed panel formats
//!
//! With `VR` the register block along the packed axis (`MR` for A, `NR` for
//! B), one *logical* k-step of a sliver holds:
//!
//! ```text
//! real            [ x_0 .. x_{VR-1} ]                                   VR
//!
//! planar          [ re_0..re_{VR-1} | im_0..im_{VR-1} ]                2*VR
//!
//! 1m, operand A   [ re_0, im_0, re_1, im_1, ...                        4*MR
//!   ("1e")          | -im_0, re_0, -im_1, re_1, ... ]
//! 1m, operand B   [ re_0..re_{NR-1} | im_0..im_{NR-1} ]                2*NR
//!   ("1r")          (bit-identical to planar)
//!
//! 3m              [ re_0..re_{VR-1} | im_0..im_{VR-1}                  3*VR
//!                   | (re+im)_0..(re+im)_{VR-1} ]
//! ```
//!
//! ## What each method costs
//!
//! | | reals packed per complex elt (A / B) | real FMAs per k per tile | accumulator planes |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | planar | 2 / 2 | `4*MR*NR` | 2 |
//! | 1m | **4** / 2 | `4*MR*NR` | 2 (as `2*MR x NR` real) |
//! | 3m | 3 / 3 | **`3*MR*NR`** | 3 |
//!
//! * **planar** — real and imaginary parts separated during the scatter pass
//!   that packing has to make anyway, then a fused complex micro-kernel over
//!   the two planes. No in-register shuffles, and the smallest packed A panel.
//! * **1m** — Van Zee's induced method, what BLIS and TBLIS 2.x use. Each
//!   complex element of A becomes the real `2x2` block `[[re, -im], [im, re]]`
//!   and each of B a `2x1` column, so a *single real* micro-kernel of shape
//!   `2*MR x NR` over `2*KC` steps produces the complex product. Costs 2x the
//!   packed-A footprint and 2x the packing store traffic; needs no complex
//!   kernel at all.
//! * **3m** — Karatsuba. `M1 = Ar*Br`, `M2 = Ai*Bi`, `M3 = (Ar+Ai)*(Br+Bi)`,
//!   then `Cr = M1 - M2` and `Ci = M3 - M1 - M2`. **25% fewer flops**, and the
//!   sum planes are formed for free during packing. The error bound is weaker
//!   than the other two (it is relative to `|Ar||Br| + |Ai||Bi|` rather than to
//!   the complex magnitudes, so it can lose relative accuracy under
//!   cancellation), which is why it is opt-in rather than the default.
//!
//! # Kernel contract
//!
//! A micro-kernel *overwrites* an accumulator tile with the panel product;
//! `alpha`, `beta`, the scattered write-back to `C`/`D` and any recombination
//! of planes are applied afterwards by the write-back. Keeping them
//! separate is what lets one kernel serve the regular fast path, the gather
//! path and every edge block without duplication.
//!
//! Kernels take the *logical* `kc` (in complex elements for complex methods)
//! and know their own panel layout, so the driver does not have to.
