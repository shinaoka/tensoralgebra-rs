//! Hardware cache descriptors, probed at run time, and the analytical
//! blocking model they drive.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! [`Blocking::derive`](super::Blocking::derive) hardcodes three numbers —
//! `kc = 384` for 4-byte reals and `256` otherwise, a 512 KiB budget for the
//! packed `A` block and a 3 MiB budget for the packed `B` panel. They are half
//! the L2 and a slice of the L3 of *one* machine (`ccqlin038`, Cascade Lake,
//! 1 MiB L2 per core, 25 MiB L3 per socket) and they are the only
//! machine-specific quantities in the engine's blocking. Everything else is
//! derived. This module replaces them with a model whose inputs are queried
//! from the hardware, so that a decent choice transfers to a machine nobody
//! measured on.
//!
//! It is **off by default**: `TENSORCONTRACT_BLOCKMODEL=model` opts in, and
//! `legacy` (the default) keeps the historical constants. See
//! [`block_model`] for why.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Low, Igual, Smith & Quintana-Ortí, *"Analytical Modeling Is Enough for
//! High-Performance BLIS"*, ACM TOMS 43(2):12, 2016 (DOI 10.1145/2925987; the
//! extended version is FLAME Working Note #74, and the equation numbers below
//! are the same in both). Its thesis is exactly what is wanted here: the cache
//! blocking of a BLIS-shaped GEMM can be *computed* from the cache geometry
//! rather than searched for empirically.
//!
//! The paper's architecture model gives each cache level `Li` a line size
//! `C_Li`, an associativity `W_Li`, a size `S_Li` and a set count `N_Li` with
//! `S_Li = N_Li * C_Li * W_Li`; `S_DATA` is the size of one scalar. What the
//! paper derives, and what is implemented in [`analytical`]:
//!
//! * `kc` — from the L1. A micro-panel `A_r` (`mr x kc`) occupies `C_Ar` lines
//!   in every L1 set, a micro-panel `B_r` (`kc x nr`) occupies `C_Br`, and one
//!   line per set is reserved for the unpacked micro-tile `C_r`, so
//!   `C_Ar + C_Br <= W_L1 - 1` (eq. 5). `C_Br = ceil(nr/mr * C_Ar)`, so
//!   `C_Ar <= floor((W_L1 - 1) / (1 + nr/mr))`, taken as large as possible, and
//!   `kc = C_Ar * N_L1 * C_L1 / (mr * S_DATA)` (eq. 4). Sizing `A_r` to a whole
//!   number of ways is what makes the *next* micro-panel of `A_c` land on the
//!   same sets as the one it replaces, which is how `B_r` survives in L1. For a
//!   2-way L1 that construction leaves no room for `B_r` at all and the paper
//!   falls back to `kc = N_L1 * C_L1 / (2 * mr * S_DATA)` (eq. 6).
//! * `mc` — from the L2, by the same argument one level out: `A_c` (`mc x kc`)
//!   is the resident block, micro-panels of `B_c` stream past it, one way is
//!   reserved for `C_c`.
//! * `nc` — from the L3, one level out again: `B_c` (`kc x nc`) is resident and
//!   `A_c` streams past it.
//!
//! **What is the paper's and what is inferred.** The `mr`/`nr` equations (1–3)
//! and the `kc` equations (4–6) are quoted above and implemented as written;
//! the register blocks themselves are *not* taken from the model here, because
//! this project measures them (see `kernel::x86`). For `mc` and `nc` the paper
//! says only that they "can be derived in a similar manner" (§4.3.1) and never
//! writes the inequalities down. The `mc` rule implemented here — reserve
//! `ceil(nr*kc*S_DATA / (N_L2*C_L2))` ways for the streaming `B_c` micro-panel
//! and one for `C_c`, give the rest to `A_c` — is therefore a reconstruction,
//! but not a guess: it reproduces the paper's own Table III `mc` exactly for
//! three of its four architectures (Intel SandyBridge 96, AMD Kaveri 1792, TI
//! C6678 128) with the paper's `kc`, `mr` and `nr` as inputs. It does *not*
//! reproduce the Intel Dunnington row (it predicts 1280 against the paper's
//! 384), and the Dunnington `kc` does not follow eq. 4 either (2 ways of `A_r`
//! where the formula asks for 3), so that row appears to carry an unstated
//! extra constraint. `nc` is a further inference by the same symmetry, and the
//! paper explicitly declines to validate `nc` because three of its four
//! machines have no L3.
//!
//! # Two things the paper does not cover
//!
//! * **Reals per element.** This engine's packed panels carry a
//!   method-dependent number of reals per *logical* element — 2 for planar, 4
//!   in `A` for 1m, 3 for 3m (see [`super::PackFormat`]) — so every footprint
//!   below is in reals, not elements. That is what makes 1m automatically get a
//!   smaller `mc` from the same L2, and getting it wrong would rig the
//!   project's three-way method comparison.
//! * **Threading.** The driver threads over `M` with a *shared* packed `B`
//!   panel, so `nc`'s L3 budget is a per-socket resource that is **not** divided
//!   among threads — but the per-thread packed `A` blocks all live in the same
//!   L3, so they are charged against it once per thread. See [`analytical`].
//!
//! # What the model still cannot see
//!
//! `mc` is bounded from *both* sides (assumption A13 in `docs/notebook/`): from
//! below by packed-`A` residency in L2, which is what this model computes, and
//! from above by the strip of `D` that one `jr` pass revisits, which it does
//! not model at all. A pending measurement (Phase 4 report part 7) is designed
//! to separate the two, so no attempt is made to guess the upper bound here.
