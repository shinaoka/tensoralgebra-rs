//! Element types.
//!
//! The engine is generic over a *real* scalar type ([`Real`]) and over a
//! *storage* element type ([`Element`]) which is either that real type or an
//! interleaved complex pair built from it.
//!
//! Complex support is deliberately expressed as "two planes of `Real`". All
//! packing, micro-kernel and write-back code below the [`Element`] boundary
//! works exclusively in terms of `Element::Real`, which is what makes the
//! planar (split-complex) strategy fall out of the design rather than being
//! bolted on.
