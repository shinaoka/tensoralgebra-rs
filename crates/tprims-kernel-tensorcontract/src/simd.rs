//! The vectorised micro-kernel bodies and their configuration builders, shared
//! by every instruction set.
//!
//! **This module contains no kernels and no shapes — only the two macros that
//! generate them.** `kernel::x86` and `kernel::aarch64` each invoke both, and
//! that is the whole reason this file exists: the bodies are written once, over
//! `MV`/`NR` const generics, so a comparison between two instruction sets is not
//! also a comparison between two people's hand-written kernels (D17). The same
//! argument that made the *method* a macro parameter makes the *ISA* one.
//!
//! Splitting them out of `x86.rs` was forced rather than chosen: `macro_rules!`
//! is private to the module that defines it, so a NEON sibling could not have
//! reached them, and the alternative was a second copy of ~250 lines of kernel
//! body. **The AVX-512 kernels this project's entire measurement record rests on
//! are generated from unchanged source text** — the move touched no line of
//! either macro body.
//!
//! Both macros reach the arch modules through `#[macro_use]` on this module in
//! [`super`], which is why the declaration order in `kernel/mod.rs` matters:
//! `macro_rules!` visibility follows textual order, not the module graph.
//!
//! What an ISA must supply is small, and each ISA module documents its own side:
//!
//! * `$lanes` — lanes per vector register, and therefore `MR = MV * L`.
//! * six operations — zero, load, broadcast, fused multiply-add, fused
//!   *negated* multiply-add, store. Their **argument order is the x86 one**
//!   (`fmadd(a, b, c) = a * b + c`), so an ISA whose intrinsics disagree passes
//!   thin shims rather than forking the macro; `kernel::aarch64` does exactly
//!   that, because NEON's `vfmaq` takes the accumulator first.
//! * `$feats` — target features, one `#[target_feature]` attribute each.

/// Generate the four micro-kernels for one real type on one instruction set.
///
/// The bodies are written once, over `MV`/`NR` const generics, so that a shape
/// change is a one-line edit and every method is expressed in the same style —
/// a comparison between methods should not also be a comparison between two
/// people's hand-written assembly (D17).
///
/// The same argument applies across instruction sets, so the ISA is *also* a
/// macro parameter rather than a second copy of the bodies: `$lanes` and the
/// six intrinsics are all that differ between AVX-512 and AVX2. That keeps the
/// AVX2 path from becoming a comparison between two people's kernels too, and —
/// more practically — means the AVX-512 kernels the project's whole measurement
/// record rests on are generated from *unchanged* source text.
///
/// `$feats` lists the target features the kernels need; each becomes its own
/// `#[target_feature(enable = ...)]` attribute.
///
/// Every generated function is `unsafe` twice over — raw pointers, and a
/// `#[target_feature]` the CPU may not have — so each carries a `# Safety`
/// section spelling out both. The counts differ per method because the packed
/// formats do; they are exactly the [`Ukr`] fields `a_per_k`, `b_per_k` and
/// `tile`, which is the invariant `panel_sizes_are_self_consistent` checks.
